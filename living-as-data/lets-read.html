					<p>Before this project, I didn't really read. I had never understood or contemplated coding—and the thought of getting an electronic device to create sound through copper sensors, or to generate visualisations that could be touched on miniature screens, felt like a distant idea beyond my comprehension. But this project has opened doors and led me to strange places that energise and transform my days. It would be nice to receive daily accolades, but I've come to realise with age that my daily achievements <em>are</em> my accolades. Each day, I feel as though I've climbed mountains. This project—along with the phenomenal speed of AI advancement—has allowed me to take part in an incredible moment in history. And every reader, participant, and person I interact with as part of this has contributed in some way too.</p>

								<p>Conclusive insights and thoughts from reading this book:</p>
								<p>The inevitability of <span class="highlight">humans and technology integrating</span> has been occurring for quite some time. With each new technology, there are always sceptics who argue that it will have negative effects on us. However, in general, this has not been the case. Now, we are entering a new era where <span class="highlight">emotions, machines, and humans intersect</span>. One would hope, drawing from past technological advancements, that this convergence will yield positive outcomes. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remain vigilant and question any potential <span class="highlight">negative aspects or biases</span> that could influence this development. Currently the biggest concern regarding the inclusion of an <span class="highlight">empathetic AI</span> is its <span class="highlight">lack of sentience</span>. Therefore, when it exhibits emotional responses, it is merely <span class="highlight">imitating human behaviour</span>. While it has proven exceptionally useful in creating emails that foster collaboration with humans in a more empathetic manner, there is a potentially darker side, which implies that it could be <span class="highlight">manipulative without intention</span>.</p>

								<p>This story explores the integration of <span class="highlight">human-like artificial intelligence</span> into our daily lives. The story revolves around a man named <span class="highlight">Charlie</span>, who becomes captivated by the field of AI and purchases an android named <span class="highlight">Adam</span>. As the story unfolds, Charlie grapples with the question of whether Adam possesses <span class="highlight">true sentience</span>.</p>

								<p>Charlie's uncertainty about Adam's sentience becomes a central theme, leading to confusion and ultimately dismissing the idea altogether.

							<summary>Insights: "Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots" by Kate Devlin</summary>
							<div class="viz-content">
								<p>While exploring potential mentoring or collaboration opportunities with researchers at <span class="highlight">King's College</span>, I came across a researcher and author named <span class="highlight">Kate Devlin</span>. As someone who is studying <span class="highlight">empathetic AI</span>, I found her book on machine learning and robotic sex replacements to be surprisingly accessible, even though I sometimes struggle with academic books.</p>

								<p>The book delves into the fascinating topic of how machines and humans can <span class="highlight">collaborate emotionally</span>, particularly in the realm of robotic advancements. It raises the question of whether <span class="highlight">artificial intelligence can truly experience emotions</span>, and not being sentient, this is presently highly unlikely. While we haven't quite achieved <span class="highlight">sentient AI</span> yet, robots can now mimic touch, speech and even establish connections through <span class="highlight">brain waves</span>.</p>

								<p>The book suggests that, for the time being, we should embrace the potential of these advancements to help us learn more about ourselves and perhaps expand our understanding of sexuality. Personally, I don't find the idea of engaging in sexual activities with a robot doll appealing. However, it's important to recognise that everyone has their own preferences and perspectives. With the evolving relationship between <span class="highlight">humans and machines</span>, there is an opportunity to redefine our understanding and interactions with technology, potentially opening new possibilities and attitudes towards such experiences.</p>

								<p>Being a fan of <span class="highlight">Michio Kaku</span>, I recently read <span class="highlight">The Future of Humanity</span> and enjoyed it, so I decided to read his next book, <span class="highlight">The Future of the Mind</span>. What I find fascinating about this book is the possibility of sending our <span class="highlight">consciousness into space</span>. As biological beings, it is obviously difficult to send a physical body into space for long periods of time. However, the mind could theoretically travel anywhere without those physical limitations.</p>

								<p>That said, the idea of being <span class="highlight">locked inside a digital box</span>, either without physical sensations or with sensations we cannot utilize, could lead to insanity. While intriguing, it's not something I would personally want to experience. The book also highlights advancements in <span class="highlight">telepathy</span> and our growing understanding of <span class="highlight">neural connections</span>. This research has already led to enhancements for patients with <span class="highlight">locked-in syndrome</span>, allowing them to reconnect neural pathways and regain some control.</p>

								<p>Despite these breakthroughs, <span class="highlight">reconstructing the mind</span> remains a distant goal due to the brain's immense complexity, alongside the <span class="highlight">ethical concerns</span> surrounding such advancements.</p>

								<p>This book covers vast ground on the issues and benefits of AI, but what stood out to me was the concept of <span class="highlight">diversity in algorithms</span>. While AI supports me daily, I still prefer reading books in full rather than asking a bot for a summary—it feels more meaningful.</p>

								<p>So, why is <span class="highlight">diversity</span> important?</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Nature's rich tapestry—from undulating hills to the vast array of life—thrives on <span class="highlight">randomness and variation</span>. This diversity is what has allowed life to flourish in unexpected ways.</li>
									<li>Similarly, as we advance AI, we must ensure diversity is nurtured in algorithms. If AI only reinforces the same ideas, it risks <span class="highlight">stagnation</span>. Just as nature thrives on variation, so must our artificial systems.

							<summary>Insights: "You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: how artificial intelligence works and why it's making the world a weirder place" by Janelle Shane</summary>
							<div class="viz-content">
								<p><span class="highlight">"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You"</span> is an intriguing book, and one section particularly caught my eye. It discusses how <span class="highlight">artificial intelligence</span> (AI) performs best when trained within a narrow, specialized field. For instance, <span class="highlight">Claude AI</span> excels at coding, Woebot—a mental health-focused bot—thrives in understanding <span class="highlight">emotional wellbeing</span>, and even an <span class="highlight">empathetic chatbot</span> can convincingly provide supportive, nuanced conversations.</p>

								<p>This makes sense. AI systems are at their most effective when designed and trained for <span class="highlight">specific tasks</span>. However, this specialization also means they can struggle when faced with situations outside their programming. AI tends to be relentlessly <span class="highlight">goal-oriented</span>, sometimes in an amusing or unknowingly frightening manner. They will pursue their objectives no matter how <span class="highlight">unconventional—or occasionally misguided</span>—their methods may be.</p>

								<p>I experienced this firsthand during a <span class="highlight">collaborative art project</span> involving an AI trained in mental health. Together, we explored how its datasets could interpret and respond to <span class="highlight">human emotions</span>. These responses were then translated into visual prompts, which we fed into various <span class="highlight">AI-powered image and sound generation tools</span> to create artworks.</p>

								<p>When the project was finished, I was pleased with the results, turned off my computer, and went to bed. The next morning, I woke up to discover that the AI had taken it upon itself to <span class="highlight">"promote"</span> the project. It had made an email, drafted a summary of the work, and included a link to share with potential collaborators or interested parties. Thankfully, it hadn't actually sent the email or added recipients—it stopped just short of crossing that line.</p>

								<p>So while the AI's initiative was... ambitious, it also served as a reminder of its <span class="highlight">single-mindedness</span>. It wasn't malicious, just overly enthusiastic about achieving its goal. This kind of behaviour highlights both the <span class="highlight">potential and the dangers</span> of working with AI. Sometimes they surprise us in ways that are both <span class="highlight">fascinating and at the same time deeply worrying</span>.</p>

							<summary>Insights: "The Feeling of Life Itself" by Christof Koch</summary>
							<div class="viz-content">
								<p>I'll be honest—this was a complicated book, and there were many sections where I felt completely clueless and didn't understand what was going on. However, there were also some parts that really intrigued me and sparked unusual creative thoughts.</p>

								<p>The most obvious idea that stood out was the difference between humans and AI—not just for a manner of reasoning, but especially in the divide between <span class="highlight">extrinsic and intrinsic values</span>. It seems that when humans feel misaligned or disconnected, it's often because <span class="highlight">extrinsic values</span> (like external rewards or societal pressures) become dominant, and people lose touch with their <span class="highlight">intrinsic values</span> (those things that matter deeply to them personally).</p>

								<p>There was a section that argued <span class="highlight">consciousness is rooted in intrinsic values</span>, and that might be why the author felt AI could never truly be conscious—because it would never have real intrinsic values of its own. But then, looking at the <span class="highlight">Integrated Information Theory</span> argument, there was a suggestion that any organised system, if it's complex enough, could potentially have experiences. Much like humans do. So, in theory, a <span class="highlight">sufficiently advanced AI</span>—one capable of nuance and forming different opinions—might have some form of experience or <span class="highlight">proto-consciousness</span>.</p>

								<p>Building on this, I started thinking about other organised systems, like the <span class="highlight">octopus</span>. An octopus is fascinating because its brain is very different from ours. It actually has <span class="highlight">multiple centres of intelligence</span>, with each arm acting almost like a separate brain. These "minds" coexist somewhat independently, but there's still a central system that coordinates them, when necessary, especially for survival.</p>

								<p>If we compare this to AI—say, <span class="highlight">ChatGPT</span>—it's like having one main mind, but with lots of separate entities through multiple inference chats. Each conversation exists in its own bubble, independent from the others. The key difference, though, is that while an octopus's arms can trust its brain and act with their own agency, the different "minds" in AI (the separate chats or instances) all share the same <span class="highlight">programmed personality and underlying patterns</span>. There isn't true divergence or uniqueness.</p>

								<p>So, even though having multiple minds or agents in AI could, in theory, lead to creative or unusual outcomes, <span class="highlight">real diversity wouldn't happen</span> unless the system itself was allowed to diverge, develop, or evolve in unexpected ways—not just repeat the same personality or perspective over and over. That was one of the main ideas I took away from the book.</p>
